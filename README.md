# daehyun_personal_site
I am going to create a personal site with a brief bio.
Three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.
Home Page: The landing page will be my first impression. It will include a photo, mission statement, and anything defines me. Example, a quote.
About Page: An about page is a place for people to get to know me. I should include my interests, and things I like to do, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.
The portfolio page: I want to include the projects I have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.
